## What is ProjectX?

The **ProjectX** team has the idea **to improve the Minecraft server community** because at the present many Minecraft server have not good community and many servers have the same gameplay such as Minigame or Survival with ordinary systems, part of reason come from their developers don't develop their custom plugin.

Therefore, *our team gathered together* to develop the **ProjectX** Server with **MMORPG gameplay** named **Menecia**. Our system developed by our developer and our building built by our builder.
